    "### Part description\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations! You completed almost all assignments and tasks of this Sprint. You did a great job. In this Part, you will need to prove all the skills that you learned. As the final assignment of this Sprint, you will create your own Python Calculator. You will need to apply some of the concepts that you have learned about OOP and \"Clean Code\" concepts.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "P.S. We don't expect this project to be perfect - you will continue to improve your skills and there will be many projects for you to apply your newly gained skills in the future. For now just use what you have learned and try your best!\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Caution**\n",
    "Each project repository includes a default notebook file. Please refrain from deleting this file from the repository, as doing so could lead to platform errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "The main file should contain a class Calculator that should be able to perform these actions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Addition / Subtraction.\n",
    "- Multiplication / Division.\n",
    "- Take (n) root of a number.\n",
    "- Reset memory (Calculator must have its own memory, meaning it should manipulate its starting number 0 until it is reset.).\n",
    "This means that, for example, calculator should perform actions with a value inside its memory (for this example, the value inside the calculator's memory is 0): calculator.add(2) results in 2.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Writing tests and documentation\n",
    "You should also write tests that ensure that the basic functionality of the class is covered. Make sure that math operations return expected results. Document your calculator class using docstrings. Add an explanation of the package to the README file. Try to be as specific as possible: include instructions on how to install the package, how to use particular methods.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Present your newly created Python module:\n",
    "- Make a short introduction to the repository of the Calculator module.\n",
    "- Import your module into a Jupyter Notebook file.\n",
    "- Showcase the functionality of the created module\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project evaluation criteria\n",
    "- Calculator module is created.\n",
    "- Calculator class performs required actions.\n",
    "- Tests are written.\n",
    "- Code is written with PEP8 standards in mind.\n",
    "- Code is well-documented.\n",
    "- Project has an informative README file.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reviewer role\n",
    "During your project review, you should present it as if talking to a technical team lead and a senior co-worker working in your team. You can assume that they will have strong data science and software engineering skills - they will understand technical jargon, they are expected to notice things that could have been done better, ask about the choices you've made (especially if you've made some questionable choices). In addition, be careful not to spend your time explaining trivial concepts or code snippets that are simple - your best bet is to focus your presentation on the more difficult portions of your code.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "During a project review, you may get asked questions that test your understanding of covered topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "- What is Object-Oriented Programming? Select and explain two examples where using OOP concepts can improve the quality and usability of code.\n",
    "- What is \"Clean Code\"? Select four main key concepts and explain them using real-world examples.\n",
    "- Why do we need to document code? How can you do it? What should be provided inside the documentation?\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "## General Project Review Guidelines\n",
    "\n",
    "For an in-depth explanation about how project reviews work at Turing College, please read [this doc.](https://turingcollege.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DLG/pages/537395951/Peer+expert+reviews+corrections)\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Submission and Scheduling a Project Review\n",
    "\n",
    "To submit the project and allow the reviewer to view your work beforehand, you need to use the Github repository that has been created for you. Please go through this material to learn more about submitting projects, scheduling project reviews.\n",
