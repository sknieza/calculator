    "# Demonstration of the `interactive` mode\n",
    "\n",
    "The `calculator` module also has the instance.interactive() method, which initializes the interactive calculator. It leverages the class methods, and performs the following operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Available operations:\n",
    "- Add two numbers together (a + b)\n",
    "- Subtract one number from another (a - b)\n",
    "- Multiply two numbers (a * b)\n",
    "- Divide number by another (a / b)\n",
    "- Raise the number by the power of another (a ** b)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notice** that interactive mode doesn't have the `root` option as there's no specific root operator in mathematical expressions. However, remember, that the root of the `n` degree is also the exponentiation by the power of `1/n`. Thus, the cubic root of 27 can be expressed as `27 ** 1/3`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Expected input\n",
    "This interactive mode expects a string as input in the format as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Add: `\"a + b\"`\n",
    "- Subtract: `\"a - b\"`\n",
    "- Multiply: `\"a * b\"`\n",
    "- Divide: `\"a / b\"`\n",
    "- Exponentiate: `\"a ** b\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "The numbers `a` and `b` are expected to be digits in the format 1, 1.0 or 1/1 â€“ i.e., `int`, `float` or a fraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Special inputs\n",
    "Interactive calculator mode accepts some special inputs that steer the operations of the instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `'quit'` will break the loop, effectivelly making the calculator stop and close\n",
    "- `'add'` will reprompt for `n` (num) to add to calculator memory\n",
    "- `'m'` displays the current calculator memory\n",
    "- `'erase'` will reset calculator memory to 0"
